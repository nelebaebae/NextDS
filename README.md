# Financial Risk Analysis and Business Recommendations

This repository provides an in-depth analysis of financial risk factors across various demographic groups based on attributes like income, marital status, house and car ownership, and profession. The goal is to derive actionable insights and business recommendations to help financial institutions tailor their products and services effectively.

## üìä Project Overview

The project employs descriptive statistics, univariate and multivariate analysis, outlier detection, and correlation analysis to understand the distribution of financial risk among individuals. We have also developed targeted business recommendations for different age groups, professions, income levels, and other demographic factors based on the insights derived.

## üìÑ Data Summary


## üîç EDA

### Descriptive Statistics
1. **Income and Experience**: Large ranges suggest potential outliers.
2. **CURRENT_HOUSE_YRS**: Narrow range, possibly indicating data bias.
3. **Risk_Flag Distribution**: Strong imbalance, with a majority in the low-risk category.

### Univariate Analysis
- **Income**: Nearly uniform distribution with minor fluctuations; wide range indicates potential outliers.
- **Age**: Even distribution from ages 21 to 79, with no age group dominating.
- **Experience**: Diverse levels of experience with a wide variation in career lengths.
- **CURRENT_JOB_YRS**: Right-skewed, with most individuals in shorter job tenures.
- **CURRENT_HOUSE_YRS**: Highly concentrated between 10-14 years, raising questions about data relevance.
- **Risk_Flag**: Highly imbalanced, dominated by 0 (low-risk), which will need handling during pre-processing.

### Outlier Detection
- **Income**: Identified as a feature with potential outliers.
- **Action**: Perform outlier detection and handling to manage extreme values effectively.

### Multivariate Analysis

#### Correlation with Risk_Flag
- **Low Correlation**: No strong correlations between individual numerical features and `Risk_Flag`.
- **Features like Experience, Age, and CURRENT_JOB_YRS**: Although they have low correlation, they might contribute useful information in a predictive model.

#### Feature Correlations
- **Experience, Age, CURRENT_JOB_YRS**: Retained for potential minor contributions in machine learning models.
- **Redundancy Handling**: Additional feature importance testing to eliminate redundancy without losing accuracy.

#### Categorical Feature Correlations with Risk_Flag
- **Marital Status**: Single individuals tend to have a higher risk than married ones.
- **House Ownership**: Higher risk for renters compared to owners.
- **Car Ownership**: Moderate relevance, with balanced risk distribution.
- **Profession**: Varying levels of risk across professions, indicating high relevance.

## üíº Business Recommendations

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Outlier Detection**: Use robust methods to handle outliers in Income and Experience.
2. **Class Balancing**: Address `Risk_Flag` imbalance using methods like SMOTE.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Apply transformations for features with skewed distributions.
4. **Predictive Modeling**: Use the insights for model training to predict financial risk and recommend suitable products.
